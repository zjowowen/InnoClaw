**InnoClaw turns server-side folders into AI-native workspaces where you can chat over your own files, study papers, and run experiments — all in one place.**

Instead of juggling separate tools for literature, notes, code, and automation, you open a folder, sync it, and work: cited answers over real documents, structured paper reviews, reusable scientific skills, and a path from reading to remote execution.

## Who This Is For

- **Researchers** who read papers, run experiments, and want cited AI answers grounded in their own files
- **ML / AI engineers** who need a workspace for code, data, and agent-assisted execution on remote clusters
- **Lab teams** who want a shared, self-hosted research hub instead of scattered SaaS tools
- **Self-hosters** who want full control over their data, models, and infrastructure

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## 3-Minute Quick Start

Requires **Node.js 24+** (`package.json` is the source of truth). If you use `nvm`: `nvm install && nvm use`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpectrAI-Initiative/InnoClaw.git
cd InnoClaw
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local          # then edit: set WORKSPACE_ROOTS and at least one API key
mkdir -p ./data
npx drizzle-kit migrate
npm run dev                          # open http://localhost:3000
```

After the UI opens: **Settings** → configure a model provider → open a workspace → click **Sync** → start chatting.

<details>
<summary>Environment variables, upgrade flow, and advanced setup</summary>

Set `WORKSPACE_ROOTS` in `.env.local` to one or more absolute paths where your research folders live:

```ini
WORKSPACE_ROOTS=/absolute/path/to/workspaces
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

- `WORKSPACE_ROOTS` directories must already exist before startup
- `npx drizzle-kit migrate` creates or upgrades the SQLite schema at `./data/innoclaw.db`
- If the repo lives on NFS/CIFS, set `DATABASE_URL` and `NEXT_BUILD_DIR` to local disk paths

**Upgrading:**

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout vX.Y.Z      # or: git pull (if tracking main)
npm install
npx drizzle-kit migrate
npm run build
```

Check `CHANGELOG.md` before every upgrade. Compare `.env.local` against `.env.example` for new variables.

For OS-specific prerequisites, production deployment, and Docker: see [Installation](docs/getting-started/installation.md) and [Deployment](docs/getting-started/deployment.md).

## Choose Your Path

InnoClaw supports three primary workflows. Pick the one that matches what you need today — you can always explore the others later.

### 1. Read & Study Papers

Search literature across ArXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, and Semantic Scholar. Summarize papers, run structured multi-role discussions (moderator, skeptic, librarian, reproducer, scribe), and generate research ideation from what you read.

**Start here:** open Paper Study in any workspace.

### 2. Work in a Research Workspace

Open a server folder as a persistent workspace. Chat over your files with RAG-backed citations. Browse, edit, and sync files. Use the agent panel to run multi-step tasks with tool calling. Import reusable scientific skills across domains like drug discovery, genomics, and protein science.

**Start here:** create a workspace, click Sync, and ask a question.

### 3. Run Remote Experiments

Go from code inspection to job submission and result analysis. Review repositories with agent assistance, gate high-risk steps with approval checkpoints, submit jobs through Shell, Slurm, or `rjob`, and monitor execution across clusters.

**Start here:** open Deep Research in a workspace with remote profiles configured.

## What's New

<!-- whats-new-start -->

#### 2026-03-26
- **Dynamic Model Discovery**: Agent panel now auto-fetches available models from each configured AI provider, merging live results with built-in model lists
- **Per-Model Base URL Routing**: Chinese AI providers (shlab, qwen, moonshot, deepseek, minimax, zhipu) now support per-model `<PROVIDER>_<MODEL>_BASE_URL` env vars for flexible endpoint routing
- **Runtime Tool-Calling Override**: Tool support can now be toggled per provider via `<PROVIDER>_TOOLS_ENABLED=true/false` without code changes


#### 2026-03-26
- **Node.js Runtime Update**: InnoClaw now targets Node.js 24+ and is verified against both Node.js 24 LTS and the latest Node.js 25 current release. CI and local version hints have been updated accordingly.



#### 2026-03-24
- **Multimodal LLM Support**: Paper Study and agent workflows now support both standard LLMs and multimodal LLMs (mLLM), selectable per-context in settings and the model selector



<details>
<summary>Show earlier updates</summary>

#### 2026-03-23
- **GitHub Skills Import Preview**: New pre-import preview workflow lets users browse, review, and selectively import skills from GitHub repositories before committing changes




#### 2026-03-22
- **Obsidian Note Export**: Generate structured, Obsidian-compatible paper notes with rich YAML frontmatter, figures, and wikilinks directly from the paper study panel
- **Per-Task Model Selector**: New model selector UI component lets users override the default AI model for individual paper study tasks (summary, roast, notes, etc.)
- **Note Discussion View**: New full-page discussion view for paper notes, enabling threaded AI-assisted conversations around generated note content





#### 2026-03-21
- **Remote HPC/SLURM Execution**: Deep research sessions can now run on remote clusters via SSH, supporting rjob, rlaunch, and SLURM schedulers with file staging and job lifecycle management
- **Kubernetes Cluster Config UI**: New settings panel for runtime configuration of K8s contexts, PVC bindings, and container images across multi-cluster deployments without restarting
- **Remote Profile Binding**: Deep research sessions can be bound to pre-configured SSH/remote compute profiles, enabling reproducible distributed research workflows






#### 2026-03-20
- **Deep Research Module**: Full AI-driven scientific research pipeline with multi-phase orchestration, reviewer deliberation, execution planning, and workflow graph UI
- **Execution Pipeline**: Automated experiment execution system with Slurm job submission, dataset management, preprocessing, and remote executor support




#### 2026-03-19
- **ClawHub Skill Import**: New integration to import skills directly from ClawHub via a dedicated API endpoint and import dialog
- **Code Preview Panel**: New in-editor code preview component supporting syntax highlighting and save-status tracking
- **Paper Study Cache**: Persistent caching layer for paper study sessions, improving reload performance and state continuity




#### 2026-03-18
- **Multimodal Vision for Paper Analysis**: PDF images are now extracted and analyzed visually during paper discussion and research ideation sessions
- **Claude Code Skills Integration**: Import skills directly from local folders or Claude Code projects via a new dedicated import workflow




#### 2026-03-18
- **Multimodal Vision for Paper Discussion & Ideation**: Vision-capable providers can now receive extracted PDF page images alongside text so discussion and ideation agents can analyze figures, tables, and diagrams.
- **Paper Pages Gallery UI**: Discussion and ideation panels now show a collapsible thumbnail gallery for extracted paper pages with full-size preview dialogs.
- **Provider Vision Capability Detection**: Provider configs now expose vision support so routes can switch between multimodal and text-only paper context automatically.
